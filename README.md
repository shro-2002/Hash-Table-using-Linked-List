# Hash Table using Linked List

This repository contains a Java implementation of a hash table using linked lists. The hash table is a data structure that allows efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. In this implementation, each bucket in the hash table is represented by a linked list, providing a dynamic structure to handle collisions.
